# About Me
I am a biology PhD student in the Schield Lab at University of Virginia. I received my B.Sc. in Wildlife Biology from Cal Poly Humboldt, where I was primiarily interested in conservation biology along human-wildlife contact zones, with a focus on mammals and birds. I also participated in the Summer Systematics Institute, an REU program hosted by the California Academy of Sciences, where I performed morphometric and genomic analyses on  _Echis_ vipers in to reveal cryptic diversity within the genus. 

My current research is on the population genomics of venom within the speckled rattlesnake complex. I am more broadly interested in coevolution, venom, herpetology, and general population genomics. Ideally, I combine my genomic and bioinformatic skills with my experience in conservation biology to attack the current mass extinction from multiple fronts.

The code hosted here depicts the general workflow of past and current projects of mine. If you have any questions, or are looking for collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out!
